                    <p>
                    
                        Yesterday, I was thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix"> UNIX. </a>
                        <br><br>

                        At a point in time, AT&T had a government sanctioned monopoly on the US Telephone System, not allowing it to sell
                        UNIX. Then, Ken Thompson(the guy who wrote UNIX), said, "screw this", and went to Berkeley University and made a 
                        UNIX implementation again. Later, about 10 years after writing
                        UNIX himself, Thompson, with his students, released 4.2BSD, with many indispensable features(the first TCP/IP implementation,
                        socket API, virtual memory, etc.). Here is a great lesson to learn.
                        <br><br>

                        Corporations do not move forward radical technology.
                        <br><br>

                        Here is a realism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law"> "software is getting measurably slower every year". </a> <br>
                        Here is another realism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Linux#Kernel_performance"> "Linux is becoming bloated".</a>
                        <br><br>

                        There was a time, where the orchids of the digital tree were low hanging, and everybody, hence, had a opportunity to eat from it. This is 
                        no longer true. You think you are a fantastic programmer, but have you glanced under the surface? 
                        <br><br>

                        By digital blackholes, I refer to entities that mirage talent, but are fake under first investigation. Companies or people that imitate
                        the progressive spirit of innovators and leaders, but deep down resent competence. Entities that would rather "play safe knowing
                        they are cheating the digital progressive faith" instead of "do what they first set out to, which is to move the digital world forward".
                        In people, you see this with the over-identification with user-space-software, with no understanding of kernel, OS, memory, networks, etc.
                        I do not say this lightly, they make the curious person resent their curiousity, and as such should never be dealt with.
                        In companies, you see this when they become big, gather inertia, and solve a solved problem repeatedly until they die off.
                        <br><br>

                        Snakes are they. Despisers of growth are they.
                        <br><br><br>

                        What we thought the 2000s looked like in 1950
